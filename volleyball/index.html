            <h2>Basic Information</h2>
            <p>Volleyball is a sport where you keep a ball off the ground. It's the only sport I play, or like to play, so it works out.
            I know it's unlikely, but I'm trying to play volleyball in college, or at least as long as I can as I get older.</p>
            <h2>Timeline and Key Events</h2>
            <p>I started playing volleyball between 6th and 7th grade, when I would go down to a park with friends and play on a grass
               net. I joined the school team in 7th grade (we were, uh, not great), did some indoor and beach camps that following summer,
               and a club in the fall. Our 8th grade team was really fun and we ended up winning district champinships, being undefeated 
               that season. After doing more summer camps, I was excited for the freshman year club season. The team wasn't great, and we
               struggled to win only a few games throughout our many tournaments. It was almost a relief when it was over, although the 
               practice was important. As of writing this, the school season is just starting up, still an open book.</p>
            <h2>Accpmlishments</h2>
            <p>There's not a lot here for now... but just you wait. I do have that 8th grade district chamionship under my belt though.</p>
